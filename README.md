To run the code, first of all you need to follow standard Go installation procedure that includes setting up the $GOPATH, etc.

Then follow the instructions at <https://github.com/milagro-crypto/amcl/tree/master/version3/go> in order to install the pairing library. Make sure you select the BLS381 curve as an option.
